        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Howdy! 

            My name is Destiny Silva. I am a Senior Geographic Information Science and Technology major from Brownsville Texas. Some of my favorite things include, spending time with my family, playing with my dog and trying new foods! I am passionate about a diverse range of the GIS capacities. 
            
            More specifically, I am passionate about how we can use GIS to better our physical world, our business and how we can use satellite imagery in multiple ways. Environmental stability analysis involves utilizing GIS tools to assess ecological trends, monitor habitats, and model environmental changes. 
            Business analyst mapping within GIS involves the use of spatial analytics to understand market dynamics, consumer behavior, and resource distribution, aiding businesses in strategic decision-making and market optimization. Satellite imagery integration into GIS workflows enables the acquisition of high-resolution spatial data for environmental monitoring, land use classification, and disaster response planning. 
            These combined interests highlight the versatility of GIS in addressing environmental, business, and societal challenges through spatial analysis and data-driven insights.</p>
